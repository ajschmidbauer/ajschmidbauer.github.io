# Experience

## Web Administrator

From 2015 to 2017 I served as the Web Administrator for the Columbiana Mahoning Country Beekeepers' Association.

I developed a website to inform public on what our association offers. The website covers resources, networking with other beekeepers, events for beekeepers, material for the press, and allows members of the community to find the closest beekeeper for swarm removal.

The front end was designed to be easy for all ages to understand and use (with responsive mobile use for in the case of emergencies), while the back end was designed to be easily manageable by myself and future administrators. I implemented an easy to use Google backed system using Google Sheets feeds to allow certain aspects of the website such as the Officer List to be easily maintainable by future administrators if they are less skilled with technology. I also designed and maintained a documentation system on all members, working with sensitive material to make the jobs of the other officers easier.

I worked closely with the association's members and the elected officers to ensure it met all legal and personal standards for a non profit website. In addition, great care was made to ensure the site represented the members' various interests in the best way possible.

## Web Developer

From 2016 to 2017 I did work with The Alzheimer Network as a freelance agent.

I developed a website to meet the client's requested specifications. I met the client and we discussed how I could create a better alternative to their current website, and we kept in contact throughout the process to ensure they were satisfied.

The website was developed for the caregivers of Alzheimer's patients to use (often elderly users). Close attention was paid to ensure it was easy to understand and navigate to those unfamiliar with technology or busy with caring for their loved ones. The website offers resources on dealing with those suffering from Alzheimer's, and provides easy ways to get in contact with others under similar circumstances and support groups.

I developed this website taking into mind the fact that I would not be maintaining it, so I was very careful to make sure it would be extremely easy to maintain and update for the final system administrator. I used a similiar system to that designed for the CMCBA that I had designed before.

Before I finished, I created documentation on all site functionality to aide future administrators in maintaining the website. I also defined guidelines and technical specifications on the new logo I had created for the network that is now being used in all official material.

## Software Engineer Team Leader

In 2016 I had the pleasure of working with Turning Technologies through a Software Engineering classs to develop a new product.

I led a team of 4 software engineering students to help contribute to a project through Agile methodologies. We created documentation, an API for communicating with a secured database, and screens for an Android Application to interact with the database. We paid close attention to ensure our coding met rigorous programming practices and software engineering guidelines.

Throughout the project, we worked with the client to ensure they were satisfied with our work every step of the way. I made sure we met all technical requirements via research into the technology involved and into the client's past products such as their apps.

As Team Leader, I created deadlines and goals for my team, and allocated work to team members with regards to their skills and interests. I was responsible for maintaining communication within my team, as well as communicating with other groups and establishing means of other groups easily communicating with each other via email. I was also responsible for evaluating my team mates and providing constructive criticism.

In the end we demonstrated our work to our class peers and to a representative from Turning Technologies. I won the award for having the best presentation in the class.

My favorite part about this experience was getting to know my team over the time spent, and learning each of their skills. It was really great at the end to know them well enough to know what tasks to delegate to each of them.

## Team Lead Engineer

In 2014 I worked with Oh Wow! Science Center to develop a display that showed off engineering principles for my Engineering Computation class. I led a team of 3 people to create a display that demonstrated water displacement. We designed the display using modeling software, and created it by communicating with professional machinists to ensure the best quality. In addition, I designed a program using MatLab to calculate the rate of water displacement based on machine configurations. Finally, we demonstrated the project to OH WOW! Employees and tested it with school children.

We went on to be voted the best project in the class, and had the opportunity to compete against other classes with their projects. We also had the chance to show off our work to local media outlets.
