# Technical Documents

I have a lot of experience writing many different kinds of technical documents, both for classwork and clients.

## Memo to Client

This document outlines the problem a client has that the organization I wrote on behalf of can fix through a partnership. It highlights my organization's experience, our plan, and similiar values to persuade the client to consider the offer. This document was written for a Professional and Technical Writing class based on real experiences, and has been edited to protect anonymity of those involved.
