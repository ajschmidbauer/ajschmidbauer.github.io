# Senior Project 2017

For my senior project I examined the properties of Weighted Connected Undirected (WCU) Graphs and proved a new property that allowed me to utilize it in algorithms. My work defined an Optimally Connected Pair (OCP) as a set of two nodes within a WCU Graph that are "closer" to each other than any other nodes: that is, they share a smallest edge. I went on to mathematically prove that every WCU graph contains at least one OCP.

## Proof

My mathematical proof uses a proof by contradiction to prove my claim by examining a WCU graph that does not contain an OCP. This proof allows the property to be used in algorithms, guaranteeing the algorithm will halt on run time with a deterministic solution.

My entire proof can be found [here](ocp.pdf).

## Presentation

In addition, I presented my findings to a group of my professors and peers. I was responsible for explaining the idea to a technical audience and defending my work against seasoned computer scientists.
