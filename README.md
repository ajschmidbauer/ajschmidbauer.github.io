#### Tyler Hovanec and Alexander Schmidbauer

# Description

Flame graphs allow you to easily visualize different components in currently running processes of profiled software. The most common use is to help graph codepaths using CPU cycles, however with proper flagging and familiarity with the tool users can track memory usage, disk usage, networks, file system access, IO streams, CPU events such as cache misses, and latency. Flame Graphs is extremely versatile to the advanced user, and supports many languages.
