Welcome to my portfolio. This space will include many examples of my work, ranging from code to technical documents. In addition, I have included a light description version of my resume for readers.

# Education

### Youngstown State University
### Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
#### Minor in Mathematics

I originally went into college to study Electrical Engineering. The first year, I gained a lot of experience with engineering principles and working with engineers from other disciplines. After studying Digital Circuits, I decided to pursue my interest in boolean logic further and joined the computer science program. As a computer science student, I discovered my talent for algorithm design and eventually created a new algorithm for my senior project.

During my time as a STEM student, I also took business classes. Knowledge of proper business practices and economics gave me a unique viewpoint and edge in my future work in the technical field.

# Goals

I hope to find a career that allows me to work with engineers from different disciplines to create something greater than just one focus could produce. My favorite memories from university consist of working with people from other fields, each offering unique perspectives to the work at hand.

I would love to have a chance to examine how Agile systems are implemented in work environments that it might be considered challenging to do so in.

My ultimate goal is to continue learning new knowledge and new perspectives. In addition to increasing my technical abilities, I hope to work on my leadership and communication skills.
